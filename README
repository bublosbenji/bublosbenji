Hello, GitHub community! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Benji, a dedicated self-learner deeply engrossed in projects to enhance my skills and knowledge. My toolbox includes Python, Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn, and SQL, which I've applied in various personal projects and am eager to utilize in a professional setting. I'm currently on the lookout for job opportunities where I can bring my passion for coding and problem-solving to the table. Feel free to browse my repositories to get a glimpse of my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in collaborating or if you know of any opportunities where my skills could shine!
