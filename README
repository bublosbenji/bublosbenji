🌍 My Quest
In a land far, far away, known as "The Job Market," I seek a tribe where my analytical magic can flourish. My ideal haven is a place where curiosity is nurtured, challenges are welcomed with a smile, and data stories are told around the proverbial campfire.

Python: My staff of power, guiding me through the darkest of data forests.
Pandas & NumPy: My loyal companions, assisting me in the art of data manipulation.
Sci-kit Learn: The crystal ball through which I glimpse the future.
Matplotlib & Tableau: My canvas and paints, with which I craft tales of data in vivid color.
Excel & MySQL: The ancient tomes where I inscribe my findings for posterity.
